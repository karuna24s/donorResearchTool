# DonorResearchTool

 The purpose of the tool is to be a simple-to-use research source that campaigns (especially) can use to quickly get donation history for individuals matching a name. All you do is put in a first and last name, the states you want to search, and the 2-year donation cycles you want to search.

 You will need the the FECâ€™s API as the source of the information
